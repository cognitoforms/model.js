## [0.8.1] - 2020-08-14
### Fixed
- prevent reentrant calls to Entity.updateWithContext for the same entity with the same context (avoids infinite recursion)
- short circuit processing of waiting queue on InitializationContext if a waiting callback queues a new task on the context
### Changed
- improve logic for updating entity lists to update items in place when possible
- `Entity.withContext` renamed to `updateWithContext` to serve the specific purpose of calling `set()` instead of a general callback

## [0.8.0] - 2020-08-07
### Changed
- provide source rule/format when creating conditions

## [0.7.2] - 2020-08-05
### Fixed
- ignore calculated/constant properties when calling entity set/init
- null ref error in date/number format functions
- remove references to remove/removeAt functions

## [0.7.1] - 2020-06-23
### Added
- Asynchronous value resolution when calling Type.create for preexisting entity
### Fixed
- Bug with nested async value resolutions during createOrUpdate (#21)
- Problems with modifying/replacing list item logic when calling Entity.set()

## [0.7.0] - 2020-06-17
### Added
- Add option to override source of dynamic property label (#19) (506b29b)

## [0.6.3] - 2020-06-11
### Fixed
- Inconsistencies with existing vs new entity initialization (#17) (c3942c8)
- Catch exceptions in validation rule assert/message functions (#18) (622ac69)

## [0.6.2] - 2020-06-02
### Added
- Add support for resource names as StringFormatRule message
### Fixed
- Do not choose "between" error message if RangeRule min or max is null
- Normalize Date and Time values before making RangeRule comparisons

## [0.6.1] - 2019-12-05
### Fixed
- Fix regression in call to entity constructor from deserialize

## [0.6.0] - 2019-12-05
### Changed
- Rename `id` in property options to `identifier`
- Get rid of `Property.fieldName` and `Model.fieldNamePrefix` and use `Entity.__fields__` and `Property.name` instead
- Various changes to private backing fields: `Entity.__pendingInit__`, `ObjectMeta.__pendingInvocation__`, `Type.__pool__`, `Type.__known__`, `Type._lastId`, `Type.__properties__`, `Type._formats`, `Type._chains`, `Model._formats`, `Model._ready`
### Fixed
- Fix special-casing of "Id" property and look at `Type.identifier` instead
- Update `derivedTypes` when a type is created from a base type
- Cache value type formats using the constructor name (ex: "String") instead of its string representation

## [0.5.0] - 2019-12-04
### Changed
- Add `Property.isIdentifier`, set via `id` boolean option instead of detecting a property named "Id"

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-27
### Added
- If the 'Id' property is changed, then change the object's id and re-pool with the new id
- Add new `Type.createSync()` method as an equivalent to `Type.create()` that is not asynchronous
- In `Type.create()`, if the state has an `Id` field then use it to fetch or create an object
### Fixed
- Ensure that a property is always either updated or changed for any state data pased to `set()` that matches a property name
- Use existing state if deserialize returns undefined (i.e. no serializer handled it)
- Throw an error when attempting to change the id of an object to one that is already pooled
### Changed
- If state passed to `set()` is an object with an Id property, then fetch or create an object with that Id
- Don't remove an old id from the pool when an object's id is changed (identifier should be permanent)
### Removed
- Get rid of legacy pool and legacy id (not needed)
- Get rid of unregister method and events (not used so no scenario exists for testing)
- Get rid of destroy method and events (not used so no scenario exists for testing)
